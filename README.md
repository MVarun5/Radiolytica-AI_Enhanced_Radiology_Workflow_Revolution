# Radiolytica: AI Enhanced Radiology Workflow Revolution

Radiolytica is an AI-driven radiology assistant that processes chest X-rays to detect **Pneumonia**, **Tuberculosis (TB)**, and **Cardiomegaly**. It leverages deep learning (DenseNet201) and advanced computer vision techniques (lung segmentation + Grad-CAM + CTR) to assist radiologists by delivering real-time predictions, severity levels, and medical visualizations. It also logs results directly into an Excel sheet for workflow automation.
