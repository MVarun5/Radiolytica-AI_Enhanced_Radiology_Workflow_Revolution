# Radiolytica: AI Enhanced Radiology Workflow Revolution

Radiolytica is an AI-driven radiology assistant that processes chest X-rays to detect **Pneumonia**, **Tuberculosis (TB)**, and **Cardiomegaly**. It leverages deep learning (DenseNet201) and advanced computer vision techniques (lung segmentation + Grad-CAM + CTR) to assist radiologists by delivering real-time predictions, severity levels, and medical visualizations. It also logs results directly into an Excel sheet for workflow automation.

# 🚀 Features:

 🔍 **Automatic Detection** of Pneumonia, TB, and Cardiomegaly from chest X-ray images

 📊 **Confidence Scores** with disease severity levels (Mild/Moderate/Severe)

 📸 **Grad-CAM Visualizations** for infected lung regions

 ❤️ **CTR (Cardiothoracic Ratio)** calculation for Cardiomegaly

 📁 **Excel Report Generation** — logs patient info & predictions in real-time

 🧠 **AI Models**: **DenseNet201** for Pneumonia & TB; anatomical logic for Cardiomegaly

 🌐 Web-based interface built using **Flask + HTML/CSS/JS**

**📌 Notes**

-> Lung segmentation masks are applied before Grad-CAM to focus only on relevant areas. You can download the trained model from [here].(https://www.kaggle.com/models/lokesh0929/unet_segmentation)

-> The project uses mixed precision training and warm-up cosine decay learning rate schedules for optimized GPU training.

-> Predictions are stored in the backend for further analysis or audit trails.

**🧪 Evaluation Metrics Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**

-> ROC-AUC

-> Specificity (for TB/Pneumonia)

-> CTR Threshold (≥ 0.50 → Cardiomegaly)
